                <h1>The Volcanic Language of Silence</h1>
                <h2>A quiet encounter with Broken Top in Oregon's Three Sisters Wilderness</h2>
                <p><strong>by Will Simpson</strong></p>
                    <p>As an unemployed ski bum living in Bend, Oregon, the Three Sisters Wilderness offered a respite from city life. One particular climb of Broken Top, the broken cone of a nine-thousand-foot sleeping stratovolcano nestled a few miles north of Mt. Batchelor, clings in my memory. Looking at the black-and-white selfie I took at my campsite, I remember the heavy weight of the silence, squeezing, as if the mountain itself were holding its breath.</p><br>
                    <p>As darkness approached, what little heat I felt escaped in a cloud as I breathed heavily into the thinning air. I chose the last small pocket of trees on the ridge leading to the peaks to set up camp. The floor of the campsite was flat and swept clean by wind, snow, erosion, and time. Though calm now, past storms had blown away the twigs and branches, leaving a wilderness Zen garden. Compared to this, my room down in the city was a landfill. Conveniently, a few flat stones offered just enough space for a makeshift kitchen.</p><br>
                    <p>The crumbling remains of Broken Top towered behind a dense stand of Mountain Hemlocks rooted in the last pocket of soil before the peak. Broken Top erupted 100,000 years ago in an explosion, ripping apart the sky in an eruption of fire and ash, launching debris into the stratosphere. Tonight, I could feel, almost hear, the silence. I tip-toed into camp as if I might wake the sleeping giant.</p><br>
                    <p>We are born into silence. Before birth, we develop the ability to hear sounds while swimming in the warmth of the womb. A few sounds are present in the womb: the heartbeat, the rush of blood in the mother's veins, and the mother's rhythmic breathing. Although this may seem passive and empty, it's necessary for the emergence of a person and a prelude to the world symphony. Before we hear the world, we live in silence.</p><br>
                    <p>Then, we’re born into a world of noise, where silence is rare and fleeting.</p><br>
                    <p>Silence is deceptive. It may seem passive and empty, but in reality, it is a force of creation. Broken Top has remained silent for 100,000 years, yet that silence is not stillness. Beneath its weathered rocky slopes, the earth is constantly shifting. The entire Cascade Range, including Broken Top, rests atop the North American Plate, with the Juan de Fuca Plate, a stubborn slab of oceanic crust, grinding beneath it in a slow-motion collision. This relentless subduction feeds magma chambers, unseen reservoirs of molten rock that build pressure year after year.</p><br>
                    <p>Stratovolcanoes, the architects of jagged peaks and fertile valleys, do not erupt out of nowhere. They accumulate energy in stillness, their magma slowly rising through cracks in the crust, creeping toward the surface. Sometimes in a whispering vent, sometimes in an earth-shattering explosion that reshapes the land in an instant, and the silence breaks.</p><br>
                    <p>We are no different. In a world saturated with noise and distractions, we have forgotten what silence can do. It is in quiet moments that ideas crystallize, emotions settle, and connections deepen. Just as magma stirs in chambers unseen beneath the crust, our most profound thoughts form in spaces of stillness. Creativity is not born in chaos—it erupts from silence, just as mountains do.</p><br>
                    <p>That night on Broken Top, with only the wind and my breath for company, I began to understand. The silence wasn't empty; it was a presence as heavy and vibrant as the earth itself. Silence carries the weight of geologic time, of eruptions long past and those yet to come. In that stillness, beneath a sky filled with sparkling stars, I listened not just to the mountain but to myself.</p><br>
