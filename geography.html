                <section>
                    <p>From the wall of north-facing windows, diffuse morning light streams into the University of Idaho's map room. I'm here researching locations for backpacking in the coming season. The walls are lined with filing cabinets designed for holding large maps and bookshelves full of atlases. Four old wooden library tables are arranged end-to-end in the middle of the room. What catches my eye is a map left out on one of the tables. It details the seismic faults that intersect the Snake River between Idaho and Oregon.</p>
        
                    <p>Movies of my past backpacking trips in the canyon flood the screen in my head—they refuse to be locked up. My legs want to saunter on the trail again, to dance with the wind, to be serenaded by the elk bugling and the wolf howls, held captive by the siren song of the eagle. These memories push their way into my awareness, looking to be relived, looking to reignite the spirit.</p>
        
                    <p>This is an animal story and a story of the place they call home. This is about a Golden Eagle, a herd of Rocky Mountain Elk, a Gray Wolf encounter, and a pair of fire lookouts.</p>

                    <h2>The Story of Hells Canyon</h2>
                    <p>Hells Canyon is the deepest river gorge in America. The Snake River began cutting its path on the Grand Ronde Plain following fault lines in the earth's crust. In 6 million years, the canyon slowly grew 9.6 miles wide and over one and a half miles deep. Then suddenly, 14,500 years ago, the glacial Lake Bonneville in Utah burst, releasing a tsunami that scoured the canyon as it raced down the Snake River at 35 MPH.</p>

                    <h2>Hiking Through Memory</h2>
                    <p>There wasn't a cloud in the sky. The still spring morning air was moist with the humidity of the dew. It smelled so fresh and clean, announcing the potential of the day ahead. The air was drying out as the sun poked over the treetops. The sweater I'm wearing will soon have to be stowed in the backpack. I start up the trail in the cool shade of the forest canopy, passing Ponderosa Pines and Douglas Firs as the trail climbs towards Freezeout Saddle.</p>
        
                    <p>Approaching the saddle, the heart-pounding ascent vanishes, replaced by sudden wonder in the face of the canyon's sunlit expanse. This feeling of awe fills the body, consuming all worries and pains. It is like the curtains being pulled back, exposing a surreal vista—an immense upside-down mountain range carved deep into the earth.</p>

                    <h2>Encounters with the Wild</h2>
                    <p>A dark shape darts into view, passing me like a bullet, its trajectory projecting it over the canyon's rim. She’s a Golden Eagle, rising effortlessly on invisible thermals, her wingspan as long as a basketball player is tall. She circles above the canyon, looking down on the Arrowleaf Balsamroot, the roaring Snake River, and her abundant hunting grounds.</p>
        
                    <p>The Idaho side of the Hells Canyon Wilderness has three vegetative zones: glacial, forested, and grassland. On the Oregon side, the High Trail 1751 meanders through wildflowers, seasonal streams, and even past the grave of Charlie Gordon, a fur trapper from the early 1900s.</p>

                    <h2>Tracks in the Mud</h2>
                    <p>Mixed in with the elk tracks, I see a different imprint—<em>Canis lupus</em>. The wolf’s paw print is large, etched into the soft earth, a silent testament to its pursuit of the elk herd. As I kneel to examine it, I imagine the wolf moving stealthily along this same path, her spirit lingering in the muddy trail.</p>
        
                    <p>April 9, 2016. Near the intersection of High Trail 1751 and Hat Point Trail 1752. In the darkness, I awoke to the piercing howls of wolves, their voices echoing through the canyon. The adrenaline rush was immediate, a reminder that I was part of something wild, something ancient. You know you are alive when you're among wolves.</p>

                    <h2>The Call of Wilderness</h2>
                    <p>The wild of the wilderness is only a faint evolutionary memory that lies dormant for most. Knowing that wild places exist touches your heart where the open sky meets the vastness of the horizon. Wilderness is, as Wallace Stegner once said, "… part of the geography of hope." It nourishes your soul.</p>
        
                    <p>Wilderness is really a feeling—a summons that feeds its energy into your sky nature, your mountains and rivers nature, your canyon nature. The canyon is wild in a way the word "wilderness" never quite captures.</p>
