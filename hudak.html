            <h1>Wildfire Ecologist Swaps Hard Hat for Office Attire</h1>
            <p><strong>by Will Simpson</strong></p>
            <p><em>Moscow, Idaho</em></p>


        <section>
            <p>It was a cold, rainy February morning to be riding a bicycle. On his way to his office, Dr. Andy Hudak stopped for a hot cup of drip coffee at One World Café on Main Street. Last week he was in Florida studying prescribed forest fires. In two weeks, he will travel to Georgia to study their methods of prescribed burning.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“Climate change is such an overreaching issue for everything we do. It’s hard to think of something we do that doesn’t have at least some implication for climate change,”</p>
                <footer>— Dr. Andy Hudak</footer>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Hudak’s current research uses aerial Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) to study how wildfires interact with the forest. LiDAR is a 3D imaging system consisting of a laser and an echo recorder. An airplane or drone carries the LiDAR systems flying over a study area, recording the echoes of each laser shot. Automated algorithms then filter and interpolate the data onto a Digital Terrain Model to represent the ground and a Canopy Height Model to represent vegetation. Other 3D models are converted into maps that reveal pre-fire, active fire, and post-fire ecological conditions. It turns out this technology has other uses.</p>

            <h2>Early Years and Education</h2>
            <p>Hudak grew up in rural Minnesota near Grand Rapids. He has loved to explore his surroundings from a young age and discovered his interest in the world’s ecological wonderlands. He was interested in ecology before he even knew what the word meant.</p>

            <p>Steeped in a culture where his dad was an avid hunter and fisherman, Hudak’s upbringing eventually led him to a career as a Research Forester.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“Ideas and things I could observe just being out in the woods is all part of ecology, so I got interested in that,”</p>
                <footer>— Dr. Andy Hudak</footer>
            </blockquote>

            <p>His formal education started at Itasca Community College in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Hudak later transferred to the University of Minnesota at St. Paul, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior.</p>

            <h2>From the Peace Corps to Fire Ecology</h2>
            <p>In his last year at the University of Minnesota, Hudak faced a life-changing decision. He had been accepted into graduate school at the University of Colorado, but at the same time, he was accepted into the Peace Corps. He chose adventure and joined the Peace Corps, where he taught secondary science in Malawi, Africa.</p>

            <p>While in Africa, he became interested in the issue of local deforestation and began considering ways to contribute to a solution.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Research and Collaborations</h2>
            <p>Now, from his office at the USFS Rocky Mountain Research Station on the east side of the University of Idaho campus, Hudak works closely with Ph.D. students from the University of Idaho. His primary research interest is in fire ecology, but he also shares his expertise with researchers in other fields.</p>

            <p>Hudak used his expertise in remote sensing to mentor Jessica Stitt, a Ph.D. candidate in Wildlife Biology. Together with Lee Vierling, Professor of Natural Resources at the University of Idaho, Kerri Vierling, Professor of Wildlife Resources, and Carlos Silva, Assistant Professor of Quantitative Forest Science at the University of Florida, they co-authored a research paper titled <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14030720">“Evaluating the Use of Lidar to Discern Snag Characteristics Important for Wildlife”</a>, published in February 2022 in the <em>Remote Sensing</em> journal.</p>

            <p>A snag is a dead tree still standing in the forest, an essential component of wildlife habitat. Raptors use large snags as nesting platforms, and woodpeckers nest in smaller snags. A tree becomes a snag when it dies naturally or is killed by a forest fire.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“People should understand that fire is not evil and shouldn’t be vilified,”</p>
                <footer>— Jessica Stitt</footer>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Stitt’s research used Airborne Laser Scanning to map and identify where and how large the snags were in the Idaho Panhandle National Forest.</p>

            <h2>From Field to Office</h2>
            <p>Hudak is an active birder with a passion for bird ecology. His research has gradually pulled him away from the field and into the office, shifting his role toward project management. Now, he spends more time in meetings than analyzing data.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“I still have trouble saying no to learning new things,”</p>
                <footer>— Dr. Andy Hudak</footer>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Hudak enjoys the flexibility of choosing his research topics and collaborators. However, like many field scientists, he cherishes the moments spent outdoors.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“One of the draws for a lot of the people that do this kind of work is to be able to be in the field and in the woods. When you’re out in the field, you remember, ‘OK, this is why I’m doing it.’ Once you are sitting behind a computer, it gets harder and harder to remember ‘Why am I analyzing this data?’”</p>
                <footer>— Jessica Stitt</footer>
            </blockquote>

            <p>As the morning rain passed and the sun poked through the clouds, Hudak swigged the last of his coffee, donned his bicycle helmet, pant leg clips, and rain jacket, and pedaled off towards another project management day at the office.</p>
